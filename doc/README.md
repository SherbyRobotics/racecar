# Hardware Connections

  <img src="https://github.com/SherbyRobotics/racecar/blob/master/doc/racecar_connections.jpg" alt="connections" width="800">

**WARNING**: Make sure the Raspberry Pi4 is unpowered when you connect and deconnect the raspicam. The connector is very sensitive and small sparks could happen making the camera unusable. See also this [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31354280/raspberry-camera-error-mmal-no-data-received-from-sensor). Also make sure you **shutdown properly** the Pi4 (`sudo halt` in a terminal or doing a shutdown in the interface) before unplugging the power. If the Pi4 is talking to camera while you unplug the power, **it may damage the camera and your SD-CARD!**

First, get some metric Allen Keys so you can mount your ArduinoMega and your Raspberry Pi4.

* Connect the ArduinoMega under the black PCB. Its USB port must face toward the back of the RaceCar. If you have a transparent base under your Mega, remove it first! It will only get in the way.

   * Connect the grey flat cable in J1 "Controles".
   * Connect the IMU in J4 "I2C".
   * Connect the propulsion encoder in J2 "EncProp".

* Mount your Rapberry Pi4 on its 4 studs. Do not overtighten the screws, they are fragile. Its USB ports must face toward the back of the RaceCar.

   * Connect the flex cable of the RaspiCAM (#6) in J3 "CAMERA". Beware of the orientation.

* Connect the Logitech Controller's USB dongle into the USB hub (#10).
* Connect the USB hub (#10) into one USB-A port of the Pi4.
* USB cable #12: Connect into ArduinoMega USB-B and Pi4 USB-A.
* USB cable #14: Connect into Pi4 USB3 and LIDAR (#2) Micro-USB.
* USB cable #16: Connect into LIDAR (#2) round connector and USB Power Pack (#5) USB-A.

Finally, **CONNECT ONLY WHEN READY TO POWER UP YOUR Raspberry Pi**:

* USB cable #13: Connect into USB Power Pack (#5) USB-A and Pi4 USB-C.

# USB hub woes
If the USB hub doesn't seem to work or is not recognized, try the following first before calling it defective:

1. Some of you will be shocked to learn that quality control on the Raspberry Pi assembly line is not very stringent. Way too many brand new Raspberry Pi are shipped with defective micro SD cards, some even have non-functional USB ports. So, first test the USB ports of your Pi by connecting something else directly on them, for example a USB mouse or a USB keyboard. And make them work.

2. You can see four pushbuttons on the hub, one for each USB port. These power on/off each port. Unless the button is lighted up in blue (the yellow arrow below points to one), the associated USB port is disabled.

    <p align="center"><i>In this picture, the USB port on the right is the only one enabled</i></p>

# Steering Offset
If the RaceCar doesn't move straight when no steering commands are sent, it is possible to adjust the steering mechanically and by software. If the steering offset is small, you may skip the mechanical calibration and just [adjust in software](https://github.com/SherbyRobotics/racecar/blob/master/doc/README.md#sofware-calibration).

## Mechanical calibration
1. Make sure the Arduino is flashed with the default firmware: [racecar_propulsion_firmware.ino](https://github.com/SherbyRobotics/racecar/tree/master/racecar_arduino/racecar_propulsion_firmware). When the RaceCar's power board is activated, the arduino will send a zero steering value.
2. Unscrew that screw:

    <img src="https://github.com/SherbyRobotics/racecar/blob/master/doc/steering_1.jpg" alt="steering_1" width="400">

3. Adjust the screw indicated by a green circle to make the piece indicated by a red circle be straight:
    
    <img src="https://github.com/SherbyRobotics/racecar/blob/master/doc/steering_2.jpg" alt="steering_2" width="400">

4. Screw back this screw:
    
    <img src="https://github.com/SherbyRobotics/racecar/blob/master/doc/steering_1.jpg" alt="steering_3" width="400">

5. Adjust this screw (called "Toe" suspension adjustement) to make each wheel straight between each other:
    
    <img src="https://github.com/SherbyRobotics/racecar/blob/master/doc/steering_3.jpg" alt="steering_4" width="400">

## Sofware calibration
Adjust this steering offset [here](https://github.com/SherbyRobotics/racecar/blob/c2b9be312659f862fb1f99670c1edd1874b51246/racecar_autopilot/scripts/slash_controller.py#L29). 

# Remote Connection (SSH/VNC)

First, make sure the ethernet and hotspot interfaces are properly configured on your Raspberry Pi (see Step 5 of [this section](https://github.com/SherbyRobotics/racecar/tree/ros2/images)). The default login is `racecar` with password `racecar`.

 * SSH (command line):
     ```bash
     # By ethernet:
     $ ssh racecar@192.168.10.1
    
    # By Hotspot
    $ ssh racecar@10.42.0.1
    ```
    
 * [VNC Viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/) (Remote Desktop):
   * By ethernet: set IP to `192.168.10.1`
   * By Hotspot: set IP to `10.42.0.1`
   * Disable encryption and open the connection.
    
# ROS2 on multiple computers (ROS_IP)

If you have ROS on your laptop (ubuntu native or in a virtual machine), to make sure to receive all messages in both directions, set `ROS_IP` environment variable on both the Raspberry Pi and the laptop. Here is an example based on the [main example](https://github.com/SherbyRobotics/racecar#launch) where we will launch RVIZ on the remote computer instead of the Raspberry Pi:
* From the laptop, connect to RaceCar by its Hotspot (using SSH for this example, but VNC can also be used)
    ```bash
    (Laptop) $ ssh racecar@10.42.0.1
    (RPI3)   $ export ROS_IP=10.42.0.1
    (RPI3)   $ ros2 launch racecar_bringup teleop.launch
    ```
* On another terminal on the laptop (use `ifconfig` to get your laptop IP `10.42.0.###`):
    ```bash
    $ export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://10.42.0.1:11311
    $ export ROS_IP=10.42.0.###
    $ ros2 launch racecar_bringup rviz.launch
    ```
    
# Simulated environment (Gazebo)

Without the actual RaceCar, it is still possible to develop using the RaceCar's simulator on your computer ([with dualboot Ubuntu or in a virtual machine](https://github.com/SherbyRobotics/racecar/tree/master/images#virtual-machine)). To do so, we provide a simulated RaceCar for the Gazebo simulator. Launch the simulator:

```bash
$ roslaunch racecar_gazebo racecar_tunnel.launch joy:=js0
```
    
If you have joystick errors, try js1 or js2. If you are using a virtual machine, make sure the USB device is redirected to the virtual machine (for VirtualBox: Menu->Devices->USB...).
    
Like with the real RaceCar, you can launch rviz like this:

```bash
$ roslaunch racecar_bringup rviz.launch
```
    
What you should be seeing (on left is the simulator, on right is RVIZ):

  <img src="https://github.com/SherbyRobotics/racecar/blob/master/doc/gazebo.jpg" alt="gazebo" width="800">

If you don't have a joystick, it is possible to add a virtual one in RVIZ directly for convenience. To do that, make sure package `rviz-plugin-tutorials` is installed: 
```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt install ros-melodic-rviz-plugin-tutorials
```
In RVIZ, click on Panels->Add New Panel, then select Teleop plugin. In the new panel, set topic name to `/racecar/cmd_vel_abtr_1`. Click and move the mouse inside the square to send twists to simulated RaceCar:

# The RaceCar batteries
* The RaceCar contains two batteries:
    * a 5V Anker battery to power the Raspberry Pi and the LiDAR;
    * a 8.4V Traxxas Ni-Mh battery to power the motors.

# Charging the Anker battery
* To charge the Anker battery, use the small USB connector, plug it in the "input" port, then connect the other side to a computer's powered USB or a phone charger 5V. If the battery is empty, it can take many hours to charge (maybe charge during the night), but it should last long.
    
    <img src="https://github.com/SherbyRobotics/racecar/blob/master/doc/racecar_anker_battery.jpg" alt="anker_battery" width="500">

# Charging the Traxxas battery
* For the Traxxas battery, use the charger coming with the Kit (it may differ from the figure below depending on the version). Make sure the switch of the motor drive is on left ("Charge"). Connect the wires like in the figure below. **To avoid short circuit, make sure to connect the "banana" plugs first in the charger before plugging the other end to the power board (do the reverse when removing the wires after charging!)**. On the charger, make sure the battery type is set to NiMH and the maximum current limit is 2A. Hold « Start » to start charging. When the battery is charged, the charger should stop by itself with a sound. Stop charging manually if it has been charging for more than 1 hour. Normally, the charging time is around 30-40 minutes if the battery is empty.

    <img src="https://github.com/SherbyRobotics/racecar/blob/master/doc/Charging_Traxxas_with_imax_B6.jpg" alt="traxxas_battery" width="500">

* Sometimes, the charger will "charge" the Traxxas battery for like 20 seconds and then decide it is full. In reality, the battery has not been recharged. Wait a minute and try again (Hold Start). Repeat until the charging cycle starts for real (at least 25 minutes or more).

* If it still doesn't want to charge, you must perform a Discharge/Charge cycle. Set the Discharge rate at 100mA and the Charge rate at the usual 2A.

```
If the charger is not already in NiMH Mode:
- Press "Batt. Type" until you get "Program Select NiMH Batt"

To set the charger into Discharge -> Charge Mode:

- Press "Start"
- If the Current is other than 2.0A, press "Start" once and adjust value with "Dec." and "Inc.", then press "Start" once to confirm
- Press "Inc." until you find "NiMH Discharge"
- Press "Start" to adjust values: 0.1A and 1.2V
- Press "Inc." Until you find "NiMH Cycle"
- Press "Start" to adjust cycle to "DCHG>CHG" (discharge, then charge)
- Hold "Start" until the charger commences the cycle. You must hold it for quite a few seconds...
```
    
# The Killswitch

* The RaceCar features a big red mushroom: the killswitch. When pressed, the motor drive is disabled and the car stops moving. This is a hardware killswitch connected directly to the motor drive. It will disable propulsion regardless of software. The killswitch is a « normally close » switch. When you press it, the circuit open.

* When the RaceCar moves around, you have to run after it if you want to make an emergency stop. Make yourself a remote killswitch when you are ready to test drive. The switch is connected into a detacheable header on the motor drive. The simplest remote killswitch is a long loop of wire that you hold in your hand. Should the RaceCar go too far away from you, the detachable header will pop out of its socket (as long as you hold firmly your end), opening the circuit.

    <img src="https://github.com/SherbyRobotics/racecar/blob/master/doc/Killswitch_Header.jpg" alt="Killswitch header" width="500">

<p align="center"><i>The simplest remote killswitch: a long loop of wire</i></p>

* Alternatively you can dismount the red mushroom from the RaceCar and lenghten its wires so you can hold it in your hand during live tests instead of the simple wire loop.

# Debug camera and lidar
Those tests can be done from the original [RPI image](https://github.com/SherbyRobotics/racecar/tree/ros2/images) without any other installations.

 * To test camera alone, do in a terminal:
   ```bash
   $ raspistill -f
   ```
   If the camera is not broken, you should see a full screen camera preview of about 5 sec.

* To test the lidar, do in a terminal:
   ```bash
   $ roslaunch rplidar_ros test_rplidar.launch
   ```
    Make sure the power connector of the lidar is connected in the Anker battery and the other usb connector is on the RPI. You should see in the terminal range values printed over and over ("inf" values mean no obstacles detected, make sure they are not all "inf"). To better visualize lidar data, open a new terminal, type "rviz", set Fixed Frame to "laser", click Add, select "By topic", then select LaserScan with /scan topic. The lidar should be shown with red points in the 3D view (in the LaserScan options, set style to Points to better see the points).
